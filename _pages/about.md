I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Harvard under the wise guidance of [Prof. Michael Mitzenmacher](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/). Previously, I completed my undergraduate and Masters at University of Oxford, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Christian Coester](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/christian.coester/) and [Prof. Standa Živný](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/standa.zivny/).

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. In particular, I am interested in optimization and decision under uncertainty, including:
1. Online Algorithms: How can algorithms handle requests that comes in real time and have to answer them immediately without seeing the future? How bad will this myopia hurt the algorithm's performance compared to the optimum in hindsight?
2. [Learning-augmented Algorithms](https://algorithms-with-predictions.github.io/): Inspired by the successes of machine learning, how can an algorithm utilize a prediction oracle that provides you with some information of the problem with no guarantee of being correct? Can we design algorithms that take advantage of predictions when they are good, while simultaneously not misled too much even if predictions are grossly erroneous? 
3. Economics and Computation: Many settings in the economics involves decision making uncertainty. When only given the ordinal preferences of the voter, can algorithm still select good candidates with respect to a cardinal utility? When the participants in the algorithm may not be truthful but trying to maximize their own utility, what is the cost of making the algorithm strategyproof (= making truthfully reporting an equilibrium)?

I am also interested in performing inter-displinery research involving theoretical analysis.

I love to meet people with different backgrounds and distinct insights. If you are interested in my work, potential collaboration, or just want to talk, feel free to email me at yichenhuang@g.harvard.edu.

## Teaching
TA for Harvard CS 2380 Optimized Democracy, Fall 2025.

## Seminars and Organizations
I currently co-organize [TGINF](https://sites.google.com/view/harvardtginf/), a theory seminar for graduate students and postdocs at Harvard.

## Service
Subreviewer for ITCS 2025.

## Misc
Outside of academics, I enjoy playing Poker and cooking. I also spend some time participating in competitive debating, mostly done in Mandarin Chinese. I currently lead the Harvard Chinese Debate Team, and I used to be the captain of the Chinese debate team at Oxford.
