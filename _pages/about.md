I am an incoming Ph.D. student at Harvard under the guidance of [Prof. Michael Mitzenmacher](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/). Previously, I did my undergraduate at University of Oxford, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Christian Coester](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/christian.coester/), [Prof. Standa Živný](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/standa.zivny/), [Dr. Anshul Thakur](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/anshul-thakur/), and [Dr. David Kohan Marzagao](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/david-kohan-marzagao).

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, in particular, random algorithms, online algorithms, and [learning-augmented algorithms](https://algorithms-with-predictions.github.io/) (also known as algorithms with predictions).

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing Chess and debating. I am also a fan of [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en).
