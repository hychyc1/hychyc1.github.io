I am an incoming Ph.D. student at Harvard under the guidance of [Prof. Michael Mitzenmacher](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/). Previously, I did my undergraduate at University of Oxford, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Christian Coester](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/christian.coester/), [Prof. Standa Živný](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/standa.zivny/), [Dr. Anshul Thakur](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/anshul-thakur/), and [Dr. David Kohan Marzagao](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/david-kohan-marzagao).

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and inter-displinery subjects that uses theoretical analysis. Some particular directions I work on includes
1. Design and Analysis of Algorithms: random algorithms, online algorithms, and [learning-augmented algorithms](https://algorithms-with-predictions.github.io/) (also known as algorithms with predictions).
2. Mathematical Evolutionary Biology.
3. Economy and Computing: Mechanism Design, Algorithmic Game Theory.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing Chess and Poker (Texas Hold'em).
