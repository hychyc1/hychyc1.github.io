I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Harvard University under the wise guidance of [Prof. Michael Mitzenmacher](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/). Previously, I completed my undergraduate study at the University of Oxford, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Christian Coester](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/christian.coester/) and [Prof. Standa Živný](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/standa.zivny/).

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, particularly related to optimization and decision under uncertainty, including:
1. Online Algorithms: How can algorithms handle requests that come in real time and have to answer them immediately without seeing the future? How bad will this myopia hurt the algorithm's performance compared to the optimum in hindsight?
2. [Learning-augmented Algorithms](https://algorithms-with-predictions.github.io/): Inspired by the successes of machine learning, how can an algorithm utilize a prediction oracle that provides us with some information of the problem with no guarantee of being correct? Can we design algorithms that take advantage of predictions when they are good, while simultaneously not misled too much even if predictions are grossly erroneous? 
3. Mechanism Design: Many settings in the economics involves decision making uncertainty. When the participants in the algorithm may not be truthful but trying to maximize their own utility, what is the cost of making the algorithm strategyproof (= making truthfully reporting an equilibrium)?
<!-- 4. When only given the ordinal preferences of the voter, can algorithm still select good candidates with respect to a cardinal utility? -->

I am also interested in performing inter-displinery research involving theoretical analysis. Occasionally, I perform some ML research, with the focus on novel applications derived from insights about the world.

I enjoying talking to people with different backgrounds and distinct insights. If you are interested in potential collaboration or just want to talk about anything, feel free to email me at yichenhuang@g.harvard.edu.
